# Triton 100 days challenge
This repository will track my journey as I code kernels in Triton every day. Triton is a domain-specific language (DSL) and compiler embedded within Python. It allows you to write GPU kernels using a Python-like syntax, which is then compiled and executed on GPUs.
Day 1 :  Triton_Addition_Kernel.ipynb
summary : perform vector addition with triton kernel
skills : 
- Basics of gpu architecture
- How kernel launch in terms of thread blocks and threads
- How to assign the mask to correcty write the kernel 
- Allocating memory with torch.empty_like()
